Pneumonia Detection Website
Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection Website! This project is a web-based application designed to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using machine learning. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and receiving diagnostic predictions.

Features
Image Upload: Upload chest X-ray images for analysis.
Pneumonia Detection: Uses a trained deep learning model to classify X-rays as normal or showing signs of pneumonia.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and responsive design for seamless interaction.
Model Explainability: Optional visualization of predictions to understand model decisions (e.g., heatmaps).
Secure: Data privacy ensured with secure image handling and no permanent storage.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (mention the framework you used)
Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (if applicable)
Deployment: Hosted on (Heroku, AWS, or specify your hosting platform)
